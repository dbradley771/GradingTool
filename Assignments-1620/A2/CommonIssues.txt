Not a proper program description.
Code Formatting: Inconsistent Indentation.
Mismatch UML.
Missing method doc.
Did not verify employee number; Did not verify gender.
Did not set this.sales to 0.0
Did not set this.hourWorded to 0.0
Did not check if you have reached capacity.
Should use employee instead of 100.
Error when there are 100 employees in the array (full).
Did not output there are none when there are none.
Did not round down.
Should not output error for 0.
The \n in the beginning causes the output to not match the expected output.
You still need "private" here, they don't default to "private".
This round down is not needed and count produce incorrect result. For example, for wage = 11.12, the result should be 444.80, but your output is 444.79.
Output does not match example output.
Monetary value not formatted correctly.
Should use polymorphism.

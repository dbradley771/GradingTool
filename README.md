# GradingTool
A grading tool for programming assignments. It streamlines the process of compiling, testing, reviewing source code and giving feedback when grading submissions for an assignment.

This program itself is to show students what can be done with what they will learn in the Java course. 

This program was created in a simple text editor. This is to show Java students that it is possible to create a relatively complicated GUI program without using an IDE.

The documentation about how to use it is in the beginning of GradingTool.java. Currently I have uploaded configurations for some Java(1620) and C(2240) assignments. You may create your own test cases for them.
